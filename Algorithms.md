## The top 10 algorithms for data mining listed in the paper were.

- C4.5 This is a decision tree algorithm and includes descendent methods like the famous C5.0 and ID3 algorithms.
- k-means. The go-to clustering algorithm.
- Support Vector Machines. This is really a huge field of study.
- Apriori. This is the go-to algorithm for rule extraction.
- EM. Along with k-means, go-to clustering algorithm.
- PageRank. I rarely touch graph-based problems.
- AdaBoost. This is really the family of boosting ensemble methods.
- knn (k-nearest neighbor). Simple and effective instance-based method.
- Naive Bayes. Simple and robust use of Bayes theorem on data.
- CART (classification and regression trees) another tree-based method.
